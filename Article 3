Today I read an article about Ajit Agarkar’s statement. He mentioned that two senior Indian players don’t have a clear idea about their commitments, plans, or availability for the 2027 World Cup. Additionally, Harmison shared his opinion, saying that if these players show no interest in domestic cricket and only focus on T20s, they might lack both fitness and experience. He also suggested that Ajit Agarkar should advise them to play a few domestic matches.
