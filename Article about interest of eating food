Hi today i read one article about what does it mean when you sometimes loss of urgue to eat solid food, so this made me a question why we humans sometimes refused to eat food that could cause the negative changes in our body
both well as mentally and physically. the lose of interest in food may be cause of worrying about something it will create stress to reduce our appetile. taking tablets and chemical molecule it will reduce our appetile.
loss of interest in food disorder occuring to ourself and it would make changes in physically we can identified this syntrome through   by this weight loss occuring sign of dehydration and abdomal pain. so doctor suggest the 
solution to overcome this by taking soups to our body as well as taking meals doing some relaxation technique.
