Today, I read an article about how our regular habits affect brain function. I learned that if we are disciplined, our body responds positively to that routine. Our daily habits play a major role in determining our
mental health. A lack of good sleep can lead to poor focus and difficulty in making decisions. Constantly switching between tasks reduces concentration and efficiency. When we respect and take care of our body, our 
mental health also improves. Exercising regularly, sleeping on time, and maintaining a healthy diet help improve brain health and blood flow to the brain. As a result, we can think more clearly and efficiently.
In the end, our regular habits truly shape and impact our mental well-being.
